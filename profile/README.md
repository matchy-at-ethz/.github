# Matchy @ ETHz

This organization holds notes/summaries/cheatsheets of (mostly) the GitHub user [matchy233](https://github.com/matchy233)'s 2-year (hopefully 2022 fall-2024 spring) long master curriculum at [ETHz](https://ethz.ch/en.html). Most of the time in English (possibly in other languages they know of).

The goal of this organization and repos listed here is to provide concise and structured overviews of courses and self-practice. The course contents may change over time so please refer to the naming of the repo to check in which year the course was taught. 

The notes and code are supplementary materials and should be used in conjunction with the original course materials -- unfortunately the lecture slides are propety of the respective authors and cannot be distributed publicly without approval from the lecturers. ETHz students may send an email requesting the materials to the organization owner via their **own** student email as a proof of matriculation.

Say thanks by starring :star: the repos in this organization, reporting issues :bug: or even better contribute back :octocat: fixing an issue, improving clarity or adding new content.
